**Project:** API Gateway Service

**Description:** This is a personal Spring Cloud API Gateway implementation by Jyotirmay Gupta. It serves as a reactive, non-blocking entry point for routing and filtering HTTP requests to microservices using Spring Cloud Gateway and WebFlux.

The project demonstrates key cloud-native patterns like service discovery, centralized routing, and non-blocking request handling in microservice environments.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

**API Gateway Service** acts as the main gateway for routing HTTP requests to backend services.

It uses [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) with **Spring WebFlux** for fully non-blocking, reactive request handling. The gateway dynamically discovers services by their service IDs and forwards traffic accordingly.

---

## âœ… Features

- Reactive, non-blocking routing using Spring WebFlux
- Dynamic service discovery via Eureka
- Lightweight gateway setup with minimal configuration
- Execution time logging filter for all requests
- Centralized traffic entry point for microservices
- Easily extensible for rate-limiting, security, and filtering

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Spring WebFlux (Reactive)

---

## Request Logging Filter
All incoming requests are timed using a custom global filter.

Example log:

```pgsql
INFO  - Request to [/user-service/api/users] completed in 35 ms with signal [ON_COMPLETE]
ERROR - Request to [/order-service/api/orders] failed after 12 ms with error: Connection refused
```
